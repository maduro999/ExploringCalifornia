@*Register the FormattingService class as a property in the view using the inject keyword, which takes two params. 
    1. is the type that should be injected 
    2. Is the name of the property we want MVC to create for us dynamically*@
@inject ExploreCaliforniaMVCWithData.Models.FormattingService Format

@model ExploreCaliforniaMVCWithData.Models.Post

    @* Remember back when I first introduced the ActionLink Helper and mentioned that this last property allows you to pass RouteData? 
        Well, the Post action requires three parameters, year, month, and key, so in order to call this action from the ActionLink Helper, 
        I simply define the names of these parameters as properties on an anonymously typed object like this. Before I run this, 
        I'll first update this Post action in the BlogController to read the individual Post from the data context as well so that I can show the full end-to-end workflow. *@
    <h1>@Html.ActionLink(Model.Title, "Post", "Blog", new { year = Model.Posted.Year, month = Model.Posted.Month, key = Model.Key })</h1>

        @*Injectable services technique*@
        @*Then refer to the Format property which exposes the methods in the FormattingService class, to get the date format *@
        @*Before you use this type - or any type that leverages ASP.net Cores built in dependency injection framework
            It must be registered, in the Startup class - ConfigureServices method.*@
