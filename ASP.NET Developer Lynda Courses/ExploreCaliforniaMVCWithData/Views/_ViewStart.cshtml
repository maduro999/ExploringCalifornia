    /*_SimpleLayout uses the _Layout as it's base layout except it defines how secondaryContent is handeled. When using this _SimpleLayout
    the _Layout will be rendered except for the SecondaryContent. It's a View in a View. Basically, any View that uses the _SimpleLauout will not display the MonthlySpecials, which is the
    SecondaryContent on the left side. In other words, this View was specifically created to display the page exactly like the Index view, except for this blanking out the SecondaryContent.*/
}

@*To fix the issue where the index page was refreshing and setting the layout everytime, the lauout code can be set in a special view
    called the view start view. The view start view is a view that gets run before every single other view in this site which makes
    it a great place to put any common logic such as setting the layout property for every page in the site. To implement the
    view start view, simply add a new file to your views folder named _viewstart.cshtml Note that the name of this file, including
    the underscore, really does matter this time. So just be sure that that's correct. Once you have this file, you can simply
    cut and paste the layout property line from the index page and into this page. From this point on, the layout property
    will be set on every single view without each view having to explicitly set it itself.*@
